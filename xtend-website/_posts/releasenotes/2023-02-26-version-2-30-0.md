Xtend 2.30.0 is a maintenance release.

## Call to Action: Secure the future maintenance of Xtext & Xtend

As you might have recognized, the number of people contributing to Xtext & Xtend on a regular basis has declined over the past years and so has the number of contributions. At the same time the amount of work for basic maintenance has stayed the same or even increased with the new release cadence of Java and the Eclipse simultaneous release. Briefly: The future maintenance of Xtext & especially Xtend is at risk, at least in the current form and as part of the Eclipse Simrel. If you care, please join the discussion in [https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/issues/1721](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/issues/1721).

## Changes / Enhancements

The performance of (overloaded) Xbase expressions was enhanced. This makes also Xtend profit.

## Credits

The Xtend Language project is thankful for the dedication of each committer and contributor. This release has been made possible by the following persons (in order of the number of contributed commits to this release):

Christian Dietrich (itemis)
Lorenzo Bettini (Universit√† degli Studi di Firenze)
Sebastian Zarnekow (independent)
