Xtext 2.30.0 is a maintenance release.

## Call to Action: Secure the future maintenance of Xtext

As you might have recognized, the number of people contributing to Xtext on a regular basis has declined over the past years and so has the number of contributions. At the same time the amount of work for basic maintenance has stayed the same or even increased with the new release cadence of Java and the Eclipse simultaneous release. Briefly: The future maintenance of Xtext is at risk, at least in the current form and as part of the Eclipse Simrel. If you care, please join the discussion in [https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/issues/1721](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/issues/1721).


## Upgrades

- EMF is now at 2.29 and later.
- Jetty 9.4.50
- We pinned the versions in manifests to match the ones in the minimal target platform for Eclipse 2022-03.
- Reload4j/log4j is now at 1.2.24
- LSP4J was updated to 0.20.0 and GSON to 2.10.1


## Changes / Enhancements

The minimal version for Eclipse Platform and JDT in manifests were bumped so that they correspond to our minimal tested target platform of Eclipse 2022-03.
The performance of (overloaded) Xbase expressions was enhanced.

## Deprecation

We marked Deprecated API more explicit and also added some `forRemoval` to them.
